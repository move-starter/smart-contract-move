## Smart Contract Details

The main contract `tokenget.move` provides token management functionality on the Aptos blockchain. The contract is deployed at:
```
launchpad_addr = "e2a0c91e582c6c62ae09fac1eb98c2a47dcca0df997007eb7d84f66b69d94ada"
```

## Development

### Building the Contract

```bash
aptos move compile
```

### Testing

```bash
aptos move test
```

### Deployment

To deploy to Aptos mainnet:
```bash
aptos move publish
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ Important Security Notes:
- Never commit private keys or sensitive credentials
- Always review contract code before deployment
- Follow Aptos security best practices
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
